## Intuition:

As mentioned in the problem statement, we have to create a parking slot which will be able to hold N(max possible) number of vehicles.

Hence, the idea is to use a data structure which can store the required data of customer and can fetch those easily(if required).

So the dictionary in python is the great choice for mapping data. Which can retrieve data in constant time.

## Required packages

- fileinput (Builtin Module)

## Input file

The input file is `query.txt` and can be renamed(If the file name has been changed, please update the name of file while reading it in app.py at line_number = 193).

## How to run the app
`python3 app.py`
